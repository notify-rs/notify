    // widths, instead of 7 like it is now. Anything 8 and below is probably good — on x64 that's
    // the size of an L1 cache line. The entire kind classification fits in 3 bytes, and an AnyMap
    // is 3 pointers. A Vec<PathBuf> is another 3 pointers.
    //
    // Type size aside, what's behind these structures? A Vec and a PathBuf is stored on the heap.
    // An AnyMap is stored on the heap. But a Vec is directly there, requiring about one access to
    // get, while retrieving anything in the AnyMap requires some accesses as overhead.

    // should go in the attrs. Additionally, arbitrary data can _only_ go in the attrs.

    // to use the information. Everything else is secondary. So far, that's why paths live here.
