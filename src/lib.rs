//! Cross-platform file system notification library
//!
//! Source is on GitHub: https://github.com/passcod/notify
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! notify = "4.0.0"
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Notify provides two APIs. The default API _debounces_ events (if the backend reports two
//! similar events in close succession, Notify will only report one). The raw API emits file
//! changes as soon as they happen. For more details, see
//! [`Watcher::new_raw`](trait.Watcher.html#tymethod.new_raw) and
//! [`Watcher::new`](trait.Watcher.html#tymethod.new).
//!
//! ## Default (debounced) API
//!
//! ```no_run
//! extern crate notify;
//!
//! use notify::{Watcher, RecursiveMode, watcher};
//! use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create a channel to receive the events.
//!     let (tx, rx) = channel();
//!
//!     // Create a watcher object, delivering debounced events.
//!     // The notification back-end is selected based on the platform.
//!     let mut watcher = watcher(tx, Duration::from_secs(10)).unwrap();
//!
//!     // Add a path to be watched. All files and directories at that path and
//!     // below will be monitored for changes.
//!     watcher.watch("/home/test/notify", RecursiveMode::Recursive).unwrap();
//!
//!     loop {
//!         match rx.recv() {
//!            Ok(event) => println!("{:?}", event),
//!            Err(e) => println!("watch error: {:?}", e),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Using the default API is easy, all possible events are described in the
//! [`DebouncedEvent`](enum.DebouncedEvent.html) documentation. But in order to understand the
//! subtleties of the event delivery, you should read the [`op`](op/index.html) documentation as
//! well.
//!
//! ## Raw API
//!
//! ```no_run
//! extern crate notify;
//!
//! use notify::{Watcher, RecursiveMode, RawEvent, raw_watcher};
//! use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create a channel to receive the events.
//!     let (tx, rx) = channel();
//!
//!     // Create a watcher object, delivering raw events.
//!     // The notification back-end is selected based on the platform.
//!     let mut watcher = raw_watcher(tx).unwrap();
//!
//!     // Add a path to be watched. All files and directories at that path and
//!     // below will be monitored for changes.
//!     watcher.watch("/home/test/notify", RecursiveMode::Recursive).unwrap();
//!
//!     loop {
//!         match rx.recv() {
//!            Ok(RawEvent{path: Some(path), op: Ok(op), cookie}) => {
//!                println!("{:?} {:?} ({:?})", op, path, cookie)
//!            },
//!            Ok(event) => println!("broken event: {:?}", event),
//!            Err(e) => println!("watch error: {:?}", e),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The event structure is described in the [`RawEvent`](struct.RawEvent.html) documentation,
//! all possible operations delivered in an event are described in the [`op`](op/index.html)
//! documentation.

/// Contains the `Op` type which describes the actions for an event.
///
/// `notify` aims to provide unified behavior across platforms. This however is not always possible
/// due to the underlying technology of the various operating systems. So there are some issues
/// `notify`-API users will have to take care of themselves, depending on their needs.
///
///
/// # Chmod
///
/// __Linux, macOS__
///
/// On Linux and macOS the `CHMOD` event is emitted whenever attributes or extended attributes
/// change.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// On Windows a `WRITE` event is emitted when attributes change. This makes it impossible to
/// distinguish between writes to a file or its meta data.
///
///
/// # Close-Write
///
/// A `CLOSE_WRITE` event is emitted whenever a file that was opened for writing has been closed.
///
/// __This event is only available on Linux__.
///
///
/// # Create
///
/// A `CREATE` event is emitted whenever a new file or directory is created.
///
/// Upon receiving a `Create` event for a directory, it is necessary to scan the newly created
/// directory for contents. The directory can contain files or directories if those contents were
/// created before the directory could be watched, or if the directory was moved into the watched
/// directory.
///
/// # Remove
///
/// ## Remove file or directory within a watched directory
///
/// A `REMOVE` event is emitted whenever a file or directory is removed.
///
/// ## Remove watched file or directory itself
///
/// With the exception of Windows a `REMOVE` event is emitted whenever the watched file or
/// directory itself is removed. The behavior after the remove differs between platforms though.
///
/// __Linux__
///
/// When a watched file or directory is removed, its watch gets destroyed and no new events will be
/// sent.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// If a watched directory is removed, an empty event is emitted.
///
/// When watching a single file on Windows, the file path will continue to be watched until either
/// the watch is removed by the API user or the parent directory gets removed.
///
/// When watching a directory on Windows, the watch will get destroyed and no new events will be
/// sent.
///
/// __macOS__
///
/// While Linux and Windows monitor "inodes", macOS monitors "paths". So a watch stays active even
/// after the watched file or directory has been removed and it will emit events in case a new file
/// or directory is created in its place.
///
///
/// # Rename
///
/// A `RENAME` event is emitted whenever a file or directory has been renamed or moved to a
/// different directory.
///
/// ## Rename file or directory within a watched directory
///
/// __Linux, Windows__
///
/// A rename with both the source and the destination path inside a watched directory produces two
/// `RENAME` events. The first event contains the source path, the second contains the destination
/// path. Both events share the same cookie.
///
/// A rename that originates inside of a watched directory but ends outside of a watched directory
/// produces a `DELETE` event.
///
/// A rename that originates outside of a watched directory and ends inside of a watched directory
/// produces a `CREATE` event.
///
/// __macOS__
///
/// A `RENAME` event is produced whenever a file or directory is moved. This includes moves within
/// the watched directory as well as moves into or out of the watched directory. It is up to the
/// API user to determine what exactly happened. Usually when a move within a watched directory
/// occurs, the cookie is set for both connected events. This can however fail eg. if a file gets
/// renamed multiple times without a delay (test `fsevents_rename_rename_file_0`). So in some cases
/// rename cannot be caught properly but would be interpreted as a sequence of events where a file
/// or directory is moved out of the watched directory and a different file or directory is moved
/// in.
///
/// ## Rename watched file or directory itself
///
/// With the exception of Windows a `RENAME` event is emitted whenever the watched file or
/// directory itself is renamed. The behavior after the rename differs between platforms though.
/// Depending on the platform either the moved file or directory will continue to be watched or the
/// old path. If the moved file or directory will continue to be watched, the paths of emitted
/// events will still be prefixed with the old path though.
///
/// __Linux__
///
/// Linux will continue to watch the moved file or directory. Events will contain paths prefixed
/// with the old path.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// Currently there is no event emitted when a watched directory is renamed. But the directory will
/// continue to be watched and events will contain paths prefixed with the old path.
///
/// When renaming a watched file, a `RENAME` event is emitted but the old path will continue to be
/// watched.
///
/// __macOS__
///
/// macOS will continue to watch the (now non-existing) path.
///
/// ## Rename parent directory of watched file or directory
///
/// Currently no event will be emitted when any parent directory of the watched file or directory
/// is renamed. Depending on the platform either the moved file or directory will continue to be
/// watched or the old path. If the moved file or directory will continue to be watched, the paths
/// of emitted events will still be prefixed with the old path though.
///
/// __Linux, Windows__
///
/// Linux and Windows will continue to watch the moved file or directory. Events will contain paths
/// prefixed with the old path.
///
/// __macOS__
///
/// macOS will continue to watch the (now non-existing) path.
///
///
/// # Rescan
///
/// A `RESCAN` event indicates that an error occurred and the watched directories need to be
/// rescanned. This can happen if the internal event queue has overflown and some events were
/// dropped. Or with FSEvents if events were coalesced hierarchically.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// At the moment `RESCAN` events aren't emitted on Windows.
///
/// __Queue size__
///
/// Linux: `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events`
///
/// Windows: 16384 Bytes. The actual amount of events that fit into the queue depends on the length
/// of the paths.
///
///
/// # Write

/// A `WRITE` event is emitted whenever a file has been written to.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// On Windows a `WRITE` event is emitted when attributes change.
