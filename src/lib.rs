//! Cross-platform file system notification library
//!
//! The source code for this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/passcod/rsnotify).
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! Simply add `notify` to your _Cargo.toml_.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! notify = "^2.5.0"
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! extern crate notify;
//!
//! use notify::{RecommendedWatcher, Error, Watcher, RecursiveMode};
//! use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!   // Create a channel to receive the events.
//!   let (tx, rx) = channel();
//!
//!   // Automatically select the best implementation for your platform.
//!   // You can also access each implementation directly e.g. INotifyWatcher.
//!   let w: Result<RecommendedWatcher, Error> = Watcher::new(tx);
//!
//!   match w {
//!     Ok(mut watcher) => {
//!       // Add a path to be watched. All files and directories at that path and
//!       // below will be monitored for changes.
//!       watcher.watch("/home/test/notify", RecursiveMode::Recursive);
//!
//!       // You'll probably want to do that in a loop. The type to match for is
//!       // notify::Event, look at src/lib.rs for details.
//!       match rx.recv() {
//!         _ => println!("Recv.")
//!       }
//!     },
//!     Err(_) => println!("Error")
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Platforms
//!
//! - Linux / Android: inotify
//! - OS X: FSEvents
//! - Windows: ReadDirectoryChangesW
//! - All platforms: polling
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! ### FSEvents
//!
//! Due to the inner security model of FSEvents (see
//! [FileSystemEventSecurity](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/FSEvents_ProgGuide/FileSystemEventSecurity/FileSystemEventSecurity.html)),
//! some event cannot be observed easily when trying to follow files that do not belong to you. In
//! this case, reverting to the pollwatcher can fix the issue, with a slight performance cost.
//!
//! ## Todo
//!
//! - BSD / OS X / iOS: kqueue
//! - Solaris 11: FEN
//!
//! Pull requests and bug reports happily accepted!
//!
//! ## Origins
//!
//! Inspired by Go's [fsnotify](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify), born out
//! of need for [cargo watch](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch), and general
//! frustration at the non-existence of C/Rust cross-platform notify libraries.
//!
//! Written by [FÃ©lix Saparelli](https://passcod.name) and awesome
//! [contributors](https://github.com/passcod/rsnotify/graphs/contributors),
//! and released in the Public Domain using the Creative Commons Zero Declaration.

/// Contains the `Op` type which describes the actions for an event.
///
/// `notify` aims to provide unified behavior across platforms. This however is not always possible
/// due to the underlying technology of the various operating systems. So there are some issues
/// `notify`-API users will have to take care of themselves, depending on their needs.
///
///
/// # Chmod
///
/// __Linux, OS X__
///
/// On Linux and OS X the `CHMOD` event is emitted whenever attributes or extended attributes change.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// On Windows a `WRITE` event is emitted when attributes change. This makes it impossible to
/// distinguish between writes to a file or its meta data.
///
///
/// # Create
///
/// A `CREATE` event is emitted whenever a new file or directory is created.
///
///
/// # Remove
///
/// ## Remove file or directory within a watched directory
///
/// A `REMOVE` event is emitted whenever a file or directory is removed.
///
/// ## Remove watched file or directory itself
///
/// With the exception of Windows a `REMOVE` event is emitted whenever the watched file or directory
/// itself is removed. The behavior after the remove differs between platforms though.
///
/// __Linux__
///
/// When a watched file or directory is removed, its watch gets destroyed and no new events will be sent.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// If a watched directory is removed, an empty event is emitted.
///
/// When watching a single file on Windows, the file path will continue to be watched until either
/// the watch is removed by the API user or the parent directory gets removed.
///
/// When watching a directory on Windows, the watch will get destroyed and no new events will be sent.
///
/// __OS X__
///
/// While Linux and Windows monitor "inodes", OS X monitors "paths". So a watch stays active even
/// after the watched file or directory has been removed and it will emit events in case a new file
/// or directory is created in its place.
///
///
/// # Rename
///
/// A `RENAME` event is emitted whenever a file or directory has been renamed or moved to a
/// different directory.
///
/// ## Rename file or directory within a watched directory
///
/// __Linux, Windows__
///
/// A rename with both the source and the destination path inside a watched directory produces
/// two `RENAME` events. The first event contains the source path, the second contains
/// the destination path. Both events share the same cookie.
///
/// A rename that originates inside of a watched directory but ends outside of a watched directory
/// produces a `DELETE` event.
///
/// A rename that originates outside of a watched directory and ends inside of a watched directory
/// produces a `CREATE` event.
///
/// __OS X__
///
/// A `RENAME` event is produced whenever a file or directory is moved. This includes moves within
/// the watched directory as well as moves into or out of the watched directory. It is up to the
/// API user to determine what exactly happened. Usually when a move within a watched directory occurs,
/// the cookie is set for both connected events. This can however fail eg. if a file gets renamed
/// multiple times without a delay (test `fsevents_rename_rename_file_0`). So in some cases rename
/// cannot be caught properly but would be interpreted as a sequence of events where
/// a file or directory is moved out of the watched directory and a different file or directory is moved in.
///
/// ## Rename watched file or directory itself
///
/// With the exception of Windows a `RENAME` event is emitted whenever the watched file or directory
/// itself is renamed. The behavior after the rename differs between platforms though. Depending on
/// the platform either the moved file or directory will continue to be watched or the old path.
/// If the moved file or directory will continue to be watched, the paths of emitted events will
/// still be prefixed with the old path though.
///
/// __Linux__
///
/// Linux will continue to watch the moved file or directory. Events will contain paths prefixed
/// with the old path.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// Currently there is no event emitted when a watched directory is renamed. But the directory will
/// continue to be watched and events will contain paths prefixed with the old path.
///
/// When renaming a watched file, a `RENAME` event is emitted but the old path will continue to be watched.
///
/// __OS X__
///
/// OS X will continue to watch the (now non-existing) path.
///
/// ## Rename parent directory of watched file or directory
///
/// Currently no event will be emitted when any parent directory of the watched file or directory
/// is renamed. Depending on the platform either the moved file or directory will continue to be
/// watched or the old path. If the moved file or directory will continue to be watched, the paths
/// of emitted events will still be prefixed with the old path though.
///
/// __Linux, Windows__
///
/// Linux and Windows will continue to watch the moved file or directory. Events will contain paths
/// prefixed with the old path.
///
/// __OS X__
///
/// OS X will continue to watch the (now non-existing) path.
///
///
/// # Rescan
///
/// A `RESCAN` event indicates that an error occurred and the watched directories need to be rescanned.
/// This can happen if the internal event queue has overflown and some events were dropped.
/// Or with FSEvents if events were coalesced hierarchically.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// At the moment `RESCAN` events aren't emitted on Windows.
///
/// __Queue size__
///
/// Linux: `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events`
///
/// Windows: 16384 Bytes. The actual amount of events that fit into the queue depends on the
/// length of the paths.
///
///
/// # Write
///
/// A `WRITE` event is emitted whenever a file has been written to.
///
/// __Windows__
///
/// On Windows a `WRITE` event is emitted when attributes change.

    /// # Advantages
    ///
    /// This has the advantage that a lot of logic can be offloaded to `notify`.
    ///
    /// For example you won't have to handle `RENAME` events yourself by piecing the two parts of rename events together.
    /// Instead you will just receive a `Rename{from: PathBuf, to: PathBuf}` event.
    ///
    /// Also `notify` will detect the beginning and the end of write operations. As soon as something is written to a file,
    /// a `NoticeWrite` event is emitted. If no new event arrived until after the specified `delay`, a `Write` event is emitted.
    ///
    /// A practical example would be the safe-saving of a file. Where a temporary file is created and written to.
    /// And only when everything has been written to that file it is renamed to overwrite the file that was meant to be saved.
    /// Instead of receiving a `CREATE` event for the temporary file, `WRITE` events to that file
    /// and a `RENAME` event from the temporary file to the file being saved, you will just receive a `Write` event.
    ///
    /// If you use a delay of more than 30 seconds, you can avoid receiving repetitions of previous events on OS X.
    ///
    /// # Disadvantages
