// Based on the Blender safe save scenario.
//
// In this scenario the backup file is renamed, re-created and renamed again in very short succession.
//
// The create event for `/watch/file` is blocked by the rename of `/watch/file` to `/watch/file1`.
// Then the renames from `/watch/file` to `/watch/file1` and from `/watch/file1` to `/watch/file2`
// are merged and the first rename is removed. Therefore the block must be ignored.
