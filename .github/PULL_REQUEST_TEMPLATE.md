## Changelog
Add an entry to CHANGELOG.md if applicable. Create a new section `## notify (unreleased)` if not already present.

## Testing
The test suite will run after creating this PR. If builds fail, you must either fix the errors, ask for help, or provide a detailed explanation of why failures are expected. If you don't, a maintainer may prompt you, but it will take longer for your contribution to be reviewed.

## Code Quality
Running `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` is appreciated but not required.
