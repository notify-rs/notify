<!-- This project is in the public domain. By contributing, you agree to release your contribution under the terms of the CC0 license. -->

<!-- After creating this pull request, the test suite will run.

It is expected that if any failures occur in the critical builds (there are a number of non-critical builds run by CI that may fail, these are marked clearly in Travis), you either:

- fix the errors,
- ask for help, or
- note that the failures are expected with a detailed explanation.

If you do not, a maintainer may prompt you and/or do it themselves, but do note that it will take longer for your contribution to be reviewed if the build does not pass.

You can remove this text. -->
