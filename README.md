## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
notify = "5.0.0"
```

## Usage

```rust
use notify::{RecommendedWatcher, RecursiveMode, Result, Watcher};
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Automatically select the best implementation for your platform.
    // You can also access each implementation directly e.g. INotifyWatcher.
    let mut watcher: RecommendedWatcher = Watcher::new(Duration::from_secs(2))?;

    // Add a path to be watched. All files and directories at that path and
    // below will be monitored for changes.
    watcher.watch("/home/test/notify", RecursiveMode::Recursive)?;

    // This is a simple loop, but you may want to use more complex logic here,
    // for example to handle I/O.
    for event in &watcher {
        match event {
            Ok(event) => println!("changed: {:?}", event.path),
            Err(err) => println!("watch error: {:?}", err),
        };
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### With a channel

To get a channel for advanced or flexible cases, use:

```rust
let rx = watcher.channel();

loop {
    match rx.recv() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

To pass in a channel manually:

```rust
let (tx, rx) = crossbeam_channel::unbounded();
let mut watcher: RecommendedWatcher = Watcher::with_channel(tx, Duration::from_secs(2))?;

for event in rx.iter() {
    // ...
}
```

### With precise events

By default, Notify issues generic events that carry little additional
information beyond what path was affected. On some platforms, more is
available; stay aware though that how exactly that manifests varies. To enable
precise events, use:

```rust
use notify::Config;
watcher.configure(Config::PreciseEvents(true));
```

### With ongoing write events

Sometimes frequent writes may be missed or not noticed often enough. Ongoing
write events can be enabled to emit more events even while debouncing:

```rust
use notify::Config;
watcher.configure(Config::OngoingWrites(Some(Duration::from_ms(500))));
```

### Without debouncing

To receive events as they are emitted, without debouncing at all:

```rust
let mut watcher: RecommendedWatcher = Watcher::new_immediate()?;
```

With a channel:

```rust
let (tx, rx) = unbounded();
Watcher::immediate_with_channel(tx)?;
```

### Serde

Events are serialisable via [serde]. To disable the feature if un-needed, use:

```toml
notify = { version = "5.0.0", default-features = false }
```

## Platforms

- Linux / Android: inotify
- macOS: FSEvents
- Windows: ReadDirectoryChangesW
- All platforms: polling

### FSEvents

Due to the inner security model of FSEvents (see [FileSystemEventSecurity]),
some event cannot be observed easily when trying to follow files that do not
belong to you. In this case, reverting to the pollwatcher can fix the issue,
with a slight performance cost.

## Next generation

While this current version continues to be developed and maintained, a next
generation design of the library lives in the
[`next`](https://github.com/passcod/notify/tree/next) branch. There is no solid
ETA, beyond that most of it will not be released before `async`/`await` is
stabilised in Rust. For an overview and background, see [this draft
announce](https://github.com/passcod/notify/wiki/Presentation).

Instead of one large release, though, it is much more likely that smaller
components of the design, once they have gone through revising and maturing in
the `next` branch, will be incorporated in the `main` branch. The first large
piece, a new event classification system, landed in 5.0.

Do be aware of the licensing difference. Notify is so far under [CC0][cc0]. The
`next` branch is instead under the [Artistic License 2.0][artistic]. Pieces of
the `next` branch brought to `main` are dual-licensed under CC0, but the eventual
plan is to be entirely Artistic License 2.0 code. The formal license change
_will_ incur a major version bump.

## Origins

Inspired by Go's [fsnotify] and Node.js's [Chokidar], born out of need for
[cargo watch], and general frustration at the non-existence of C/Rust
cross-platform notify libraries.
